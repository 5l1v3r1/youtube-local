    <div id="tor-note"><b>Note on using Tor to log in</b><br>
Using Tor to log in should only be done if the account was created using a proxy/VPN/Tor to begin with and hasn't been logged in using your IP. Otherwise, it's pointless since Google already knows who the account belongs to. When logging into a google account, it must be logged in using an IP address geographically close to the area where the account was created or where it is logged into regularly. If the account was created using an IP address in America and is logged into from an IP in Russia, Google will block the Russian IP from logging in, assume someone knows your password, lock the account, and make you change your password. If creating an account using Tor, you must remember the IP (or geographic region) it was created in, and only log in using that geographic region for the exit node. This can be accomplished by <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/733/can-i-exit-from-a-specific-country-or-node">putting the desired IP in the torrc file</a> to force Tor to use that exit node. Using the login cookie to post comments through Tor is perfectly safe, however.
